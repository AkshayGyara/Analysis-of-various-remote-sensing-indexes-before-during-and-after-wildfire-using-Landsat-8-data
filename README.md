# Analysis-of-various-remote-sensing-indexes-before-during-and-after-wildfire-using-Landsat-8-data

This is an attempts to study remote sensing indexes before, during and after  wildfire occurrence. A combination of these indexes can be a good indicator of wildfire. This risk index can determine the probability of occurrence of fire in a particular season, in specific regions - high vegetation region, urban region etc.
